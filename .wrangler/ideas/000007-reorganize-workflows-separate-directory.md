## Original Idea (User's Exact Words)

what if the solution for better organizing workflows was to have a workflows dir outside of skills. claude code inserts a prompt that says "go check if you have relevant skills before you go forward on this propmt", effectively. we should also go do some research into whether it's beneficial to keep our skills library thinner. Maybe it'll improve our control over skill invocation if we pull more out of skills and keep the total number lower. but maybe there's a benefit to having other logical groupings like "tasks"?

## Context

User is exploring better organization of wrangler's skill library and wondering if separating workflows from skills would help with Claude Code's skill discovery and invocation control.
