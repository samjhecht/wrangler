# Specification: Figma Design Workflow Integration

## Executive Summary

**What:** A comprehensive Figma integration for Wrangler that enables AI agents to manage design-to-implementation workflows, including automated design system setup, specification-to-mockup generation, and design system governance. This integration leverages the official Figma MCP server to provide seamless design context for implementation.

**Why:** There's a critical gap in wrangler's development process between specification and implementation. The goal is to **improve frontend application development results** by adding a design step that reduces alignment issues between users and agents. By having reviewed/approved Figma mocks before implementation, users can expect pixel-perfect implementation with verifiable gates (comparing implementation against signed-off mocks). This systematic approach aims to bridge the design-implementation gap and enable better verification throughout the development process.

**Scope:**
- **Included:**
  - Integration with official Figma MCP server
  - Three new wrangler skills: `design-system-setup`, `figma-design-workflow`, `design-system-governance`
  - Design system templates bundled with wrangler plugin (minimal, modern, vibrant)
  - Automated design token extraction and drift detection
  - Interactive Q&A-driven design system initialization with template selection
  - Option to use templates + frontend-design skill for AI-generated custom designs
  - Specification → Figma mockup workflow with issue tracking
  - Design system component library management (hierarchical: master design system + feature files)
  - Figma native versioning integration
  
- **Excluded:**
  - Visual regression testing (future phase - will enable pixel-perfect verification)
  - Code generation from Figma designs (relies on official Figma MCP capabilities)
  - Figma plugin development (using official MCP server only)
  - Multi-user design collaboration features
  - Enterprise SSO/advanced Figma permissions

**Status:** Approved (ready for implementation)

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals

1. **Improve frontend development results**: Reduce alignment issues between users and AI agents by introducing systematic design step before implementation
2. **Enable verification gates**: Signed-off Figma mocks provide baseline for pixel-perfect implementation validation
3. **Bridge design-implementation gap**: Make Figma design context accessible to AI agents during implementation
4. **Design system consistency**: Ensure design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) stay synchronized between Figma and code
5. **Reduce manual handoff overhead**: Automate extraction of design specifications from Figma files
6. **Lower barrier to entry**: Provide starter design system templates so projects can have professional design foundations immediately
7. **Systematic design governance**: Track and resolve design token drift through wrangler's issue system
8. **Standalone invocability**: Skills can be invoked independently, not tightly coupled to existing workflows (allows gradual adoption)

### Non-Goals

1. **Require human refinement of AI-generated designs**: While experience suggests refinement may be needed initially, the goal is to achieve high-quality AI-generated designs without mandatory human intervention. Human refinement is a pragmatic acknowledgment of current limitations, not an architectural constraint.
2. **Visual regression testing** (this phase): Validation that implementation matches Figma will be future work (enables pixel-perfect verification against approved mocks)
3. **Figma file management**: Not building version control or backup systems for Figma files (relying on Figma native versioning)
4. **Custom Figma plugin**: Using official Figma MCP server exclusively
5. **Design collaboration features**: Not building team commenting, versioning, or approval workflows
6. **Opinionated design choices**: Design system templates are starting points, not mandates

## Background & Context

### Problem Statement

**Current pain points:**

1. **Design-code disconnect**: Specifications describe features but lack visual context. Designers create mockups in Figma, but agents can't access them during implementation.

2. **Inconsistent design systems**: Projects reinvent color palettes, typography scales, and spacing systems. No systematic way to ensure code matches design tokens.

3. **Manual handoff overhead**: Developers manually extract measurements, colors, and styles from Figma. Error-prone and time-consuming.

4. **No design governance**: Design systems drift over time. No automated detection when code diverges from Figma-defined tokens.

5. **High barrier to design quality**: Small projects skip design systems entirely because setup is complex.

6. **Alignment issues in frontend development**: Without visual specifications, agents and users often have different mental models of what's being built, leading to rework.

7. **No verification baseline**: Without approved mockups, difficult to objectively verify if implementation matches intent.

### Current State

**How wrangler works today:**

1. User creates specification via `writing-specifications` skill
2. Specification is broken into implementation tasks via `writing-plans` skill
3. Agent implements code following specification text description
4. No access to Figma design context
5. No design system templates or governance
6. Visual design decisions made ad-hoc during implementation
7. No systematic verification that implementation matches user's visual intent

**Problems with current state:**

- Agents can't see designer's visual intent
- No reusable design foundations (colors, typography, spacing)
- Implementation diverges from design without detection
- Design quality depends on individual agent decisions
- Alignment issues between user expectations and implementation
- Difficult to verify implementation quality objectively

### Proposed State

**How design workflow will work:**

1. **Project initialization:**
   - User creates first specification with UI requirements
   - Agent auto-detects no design system exists
   - Agent prompts: "I notice you don't have a design system set up. Would you like me to create one now?"
   - User chooses:
     - **Option A**: Run full `setup-design-system` skill (Q&A for custom preferences)
     - **Option B**: Agent uses template + `frontend-design` skill to generate custom design system
   - Creates Figma design system from selected approach
   - Exports design tokens to code (CSS variables, Tailwind config, etc.)

2. **Specification → Mockup workflow:**
   - User creates specification via `writing-specifications` skill
   - Agent invokes `figma-design-workflow` skill
   - Skill reads spec, generates Figma mockups (frames, components)
   - Feature mockups reference master design system as library (hierarchical Figma structure)
   - Links Figma file URL in wrangler issue for review
   - User reviews and approves mockups in Figma
   - Approved mockups become verification baseline for implementation
   - Agent extracts design context during implementation

3. **Ongoing governance:**
   - Agent periodically runs `design-system-governance` skill
   - Extracts design tokens from Figma
   - Compares against code tokens
   - Creates wrangler issues for detected drift (report only, no auto-fix)
   - Provides reconciliation recommendations
   - Tracks governance history using Figma native versioning

**Benefits:**

✅ Improved frontend development results through systematic design step  
✅ Verified alignment: approved mocks provide objective baseline  
✅ Designers and agents work from same Figma source of truth  
✅ Design systems available to all projects via templates  
✅ Automated drift detection prevents divergence  
✅ Visual specifications captured in Figma, accessible to agents  
✅ Standalone skills allow gradual workflow integration  
✅ Foundation for future pixel-perfect verification (visual regression testing)

| Multiple Figma files? | Single file, multiple files, hierarchical | Hierarchical | Master design system + child feature files; aligns with Figma component library system | 2025-11-21 |
| Drift auto-fix? | Report only, auto-fix with approval, configurable | Report only | Safe default; creates issues for manual resolution | 2025-11-21 |
| Design system versioning? | Semantic versioning, timestamp, Figma native | Figma native versioning | Simplest; leverages Figma's built-in file history | 2025-11-21 |
