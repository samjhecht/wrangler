I just made some changes to our \_roadmap.md. you'll see it in the diff. I'd like you to get
yourself
caught up on this project. take a look at recent commits, review specs we implemented. read about
the architecture and overall vision. Then I'd like you to take a look at those changes I made to
the
\_roadmap.md file laying out a set of major features and near-term objective for end to end
functionality. Here they are again for your reference:

[Pasted text #1 +18 lines]

I'd like you to send subagents to go work on specs for each of the key new features we need to get
this project done. make sure they use our "writing-specifications" skill.

your job as the orchestrator will be to make sure that at the end of the process, we have all the
specifications needed to fully achieve the testing steps described. feel free to break my feature
bullets down further into smaller chunks wherever you think is best. if any of the subagents using
our "writing-specifications" skill have clarifying questions, answer them if you think any are pretty
obvious from your perspective seeing the end to end goal. If you think they really could use user
feedback, record them in the bottom of the \_roadmap.md file and in the meantime, respond to the
subagent that they should go send a research subagent to come up with the best solution that will be
good from a security perspective, will leverage opensource if a good os option exists, and seeks to
keep things simple.
