## Overview

Slash commands are **shortcuts to activate wrangler skills** with specific workflows. Instead of manually invoking skills, users can type `/command-name` to trigger predefined behaviors.

### Benefits

- **Faster access** to common workflows
- **Consistent naming** across projects
- **Discoverable** via `/help` command
- **Composable** with other Claude Code features

### Command Syntax

```
/wrangler:command-name [arguments]
```

**Prefix**: All wrangler commands start with `/wrangler:`

**Namespace**: Prevents conflicts with other plugins

**Arguments**: Some commands accept optional parameters (rare)

---

## How Slash Commands Work

### Execution Flow

```
User Types: /wrangler:brainstorm
    ↓
Claude Code Parses Command
    ↓
Looks Up Command in: commands/brainstorm.md
    ↓
Reads Command File Contents
    ↓
Expands to Full Prompt (from command file)
    ↓
Executes Prompt as if User Typed It
```

### Command File Format

**Location**: `commands/{command-name}.md`

**Contents**: Plain text prompt that gets injected

**Example** (`commands/brainstorm.md`):
```markdown
Invoke the brainstorming skill to refine this idea into a fully-formed design through Socratic questioning.
```

When user types `/wrangler:brainstorm`, Claude sees:
```
Invoke the brainstorming skill to refine this idea into a fully-formed design through Socratic questioning.
```

### Skill vs Command vs Tool

| Type | Purpose | Example | Invocation |
|------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Skill** | Detailed workflow instructions | `test-driven-development` | Automatic (when applicable) |
| **Command** | Shortcut to invoke skill | `/wrangler:brainstorm` | User types command |
| **Tool** | Programmatic function | `issues_create` | Code calls tool |

**Relationship**:
- Commands → Activate Skills
- Skills → May use Tools
- Tools → Standalone functions

---

## Creating Custom Commands

### Command File Structure

**Minimal Command**:
```markdown
Run the test suite and report results.
```

**Detailed Command**:
```markdown
# Task: Implement Feature X

Use the following workflow:

1. Review requirements in SPEC.md
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Implement feature
4. Run tests
5. Update documentation

Apply these principles:
- Functions ≤50 lines
- Test coverage >80%
- No commented-out code

Report progress after each step.
```

### Command Naming Conventions

**Good Names**:
- `/wrangler:run-tests` (verb + noun, clear action)
- `/wrangler:update-yourself` (verb + target)
- `/wrangler:analyze-session-gaps` (verb + what to analyze)

**Bad Names**:
- `/wrangler:test` (too vague)
- `/wrangler:go` (unclear action)
- `/wrangler:doit` (unprofessional)

### Creating a New Command

**Steps**:

1. **Create command file**:
   ```bash
   touch commands/my-command.md
   ```

2. **Write prompt**:
   ```markdown
   Invoke the [skill-name] skill to [accomplish goal].

   [Optional: Additional context or parameters]
   ```

3. **Test manually**:
   ```bash
   # Activate in Claude Code
   /wrangler:my-command

   # Verify it does what you expect
   ```

4. **Document**:
   - Add entry to this document
   - Update README.md if widely useful
   - Create skill documentation if creating new skill

**Example**:

`commands/review-code.md`:
```markdown
Invoke the code-reviewer skill to systematically review all code changes in the current branch.

Focus on:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code quality
- Test coverage

Provide detailed report with severity levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW).
```

Usage: `/wrangler:review-code`

### Command Parameters

**Simple Parameters** (not currently supported but planned):
```markdown
/wrangler:run-tests --coverage
/wrangler:brainstorm --depth=deep
```

**Workaround** (current):
```
User: /wrangler:brainstorm

Focus on scalability and performance.

Claude: I'll brainstorm with focus on scalability and performance.
```

## Command Best Practices

### Do's

✅ **Use descriptive names**: `/wrangler:analyze-session-gaps` is better than `/wrangler:gaps`

✅ **Invoke skills explicitly**: "Invoke the X skill to accomplish Y"

✅ **Provide context**: Include relevant parameters or focus areas

✅ **Test thoroughly**: Ensure command does what it claims

✅ **Document purpose**: Explain when to use command

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't duplicate functionality**: Reuse existing commands/skills

❌ **Don't create overly specific commands**: `/wrangler:fix-bug-in-auth.ts` is too specific

❌ **Don't hardcode project details**: Commands should work for any project

❌ **Don't skip skill activation**: Commands should invoke skills, not reimplement them

❌ **Don't create commands for trivial tasks**: "Read file X" doesn't need a command

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

**Symptom**: `/wrangler:my-command` shows "Command not found"

**Causes**:
1. Command file doesn't exist
2. File in wrong location
3. Filename doesn't match command name
4. Plugin not loaded

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Verify file exists
ls ~/.claude/plugins/wrangler/commands/my-command.md

# Check filename matches command (no /wrangler: prefix in file)
# Correct: commands/brainstorm.md
# Wrong: commands/wrangler:brainstorm.md

# Restart Claude Code to reload plugin
```

### Command Does Nothing

**Symptom**: Command executes but Claude doesn't follow instructions

**Causes**:
1. Command file empty or contains invalid content
2. Prompt too vague
3. Skill not found
4. Conflicting instructions

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Verify command file has content
cat ~/.claude/plugins/wrangler/commands/my-command.md

# Verify skill exists (if command invokes skill)
ls ~/.claude/plugins/wrangler/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# Make prompt more explicit:
# Bad: "Do something with tests"
# Good: "Invoke the test-runner skill to execute the full test suite"
```

### Command Conflicts with Other Plugin

**Symptom**: Multiple plugins have same command name

**Cause**: Command name collision

**Solution**:
- Use unique prefix (`/wrangler:` vs `/other-plugin:`)
- Rename command to be more specific
- Disable conflicting plugin

---

## Advanced Topics

### Dynamic Commands

**Goal**: Generate commands programmatically based on project context

**Current State**: Not supported (commands are static files)

**Future**: Potential skill to generate custom commands per project

**Workaround**: Use template commands with parameters in user message

### Command Composition

**Goal**: Chain multiple commands together

**Example**:
```
/wrangler:brainstorm && /wrangler:write-plan && /wrangler:execute-plan
```

**Current State**: Not supported (each command is independent)

**Workaround**: Run commands sequentially, copy output between

### Command Aliases

**Goal**: Shorter aliases for frequently used commands

**Example**:
```
/w:bs → /wrangler:brainstorm
/w:wp → /wrangler:write-plan
```

**Current State**: Not supported

**Workaround**: Use Claude Code's custom snippets feature
