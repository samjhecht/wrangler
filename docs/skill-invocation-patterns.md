# Skill Invocation Patterns

This document maps common task patterns to the skills that should be invoked. Use this to validate whether appropriate skills were used during a session.

**Purpose**: Enable compliance validation - did the agent use the right skills for the task?

---

## Always-Required Skills

These skills are **MANDATORY** for specific activities and should NEVER be skipped:

### test-driven-development

**Always required when**:
- Implementing new features
- Fixing bugs
- Changing behavior
- Refactoring code

**Exception scenarios** (ask user first):
- Throwaway prototypes
- Generated code
- Configuration files

**Detection patterns**:
- Keywords: "implement", "add feature", "fix bug", "change", "refactor"
- File operations: Creating/modifying `.ts`, `.js`, `.py`, `.rs`, `.go` files
- Behavior changes: Modifying functions, classes, modules

**Compliance check**:
- Were tests written FIRST?
- Was RED phase verified (test failed)?
- Was GREEN phase verified (test passed)?
- Was TDD Compliance Certification provided?

---

### verification-before-completion

**Always required when**:
- Making ANY completion claim
- Making ANY success claim
- Expressing ANY satisfaction ("Great!", "Done!", "Perfect!")
- About to commit/push/PR
- About to move to next task

**Detection patterns**:
- Keywords: "complete", "done", "finished", "ready", "works", "passes", "succeeds"
- Positive language: "great", "perfect", "good to go"
- Action verbs: "commit", "merge", "deploy", "ship"

**Compliance check**:
- Was verification command run FRESH?
- Was COMPLETE output provided?
- Were TDD compliance requirements met?
- Was code review obtained?
- Were all requirements verified?

---

### requesting-code-review

**Always required when**:
- Completing ANY code change
- Before committing code changes
- Before creating pull request
- Before claiming task complete

**Exceptions** (ONLY these 3):
1. Pure documentation (*.md in docs/ only, ZERO code)
2. Configuration-only (dependency updates, NO logic)
3. Emergency hotfix (production down, MUST review within 24h)

**Detection patterns**:
- File changes: Any `.ts`, `.js`, `.py`, `.rs`, `.go`, etc.
- Code modifications: Functions, classes, logic changes
- Feature implementation: New capabilities added
- Bug fixes: Behavior corrections

**Compliance check**:
- Was code-review skill invoked?
- Was review completed?
- Were Critical issues: 0?
- Were Important issues: 0 OR converted to tracked issues?
- Was review status: Approved?

---

## Context-Triggered Skills

These skills should trigger based on specific contexts:

### dispatching-parallel-agents

**Triggers when**:
- 3+ test files failing with different root causes
- 3+ independent bugs identified
- Multiple subsystems broken independently
- Complex implementation with 10+ independent tasks

**Prerequisites**:
- Failures are logically independent (different root causes)
- Investigation is parallel-safe (no shared state conflicts)
  OR dispatch for investigation only, fix sequentially

**Detection patterns**:
- Multiple test file failures across different features
- Multiple bug reports for different subsystems
- Large implementation plans with independent modules

**Compliance check**:
- Were failures verified as independent?
- Was parallel safety checked?
- Were focused agent prompts created?
- Were agent results verified independently?

---

### writing-plans

**Triggers when**:
- Design is complete, need implementation tasks
- Specification exists, need breakdown
- Complex feature requires task organization
- User asks for implementation plan

**Detection patterns**:
- Keywords: "plan", "break down", "tasks", "implementation steps"
- After specification creation
- Before complex implementation

**Compliance check**:
- Were MCP issues created for each task?
- Do issues contain complete code examples?
- Do issues include all 5 TDD steps?
- Is optional plan file created if needed (10+ tasks, multiple components)?
- Do issues reference specification?

---

### check-constitutional-alignment

**Triggers when**:
- User proposes new feature
- Before creating specification
- During roadmap discussions
- Reviewing significant changes
- When uncertain if feature fits project

**Detection patterns**:
- Keywords: "should we", "what about", "new feature idea"
- Feature proposals
- Scope discussions
- Architecture debates

**Compliance check**:
- Was constitution read?
- Were all decision framework questions answered?
- Was clear decision rendered (APPROVED/REVISE/REJECT)?
- Was reasoning provided for each principle?

---

### systematic-debugging

**Triggers when**:
- Bug exists but root cause unknown
- Multiple related failures (same root cause)
- Test failures are cascading
- Need to understand system behavior

**Prerequisites**:
- Bug is reproducible
- Failures are related (NOT independent)

**Detection patterns**:
- Keywords: "bug", "broken", "failing", "error", "crash"
- Test failures with unknown cause
- Unexpected behavior

**Compliance check**:
- Was hypothesis formed?
- Was hypothesis tested?
- Was root cause identified?
- Was fix minimal?
- Was regression test added?

└─ NO → systematic-debugging (find common root cause)
```

**Compliance checks**:
- Independence verified?

## File Pattern → Skill Mapping

### Code Files Created/Modified

**Patterns**:
- `*.ts`, `*.js`, `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`
- `*.py`
- `*.rs`
- `*.go`
- `*.java`, `*.kt`

**Triggers**:
1. `test-driven-development` - ALWAYS
2. `requesting-code-review` - ALWAYS (except 3 exceptions)
3. `verification-before-completion` - ALWAYS before completion claims

---

### Test Files Created/Modified

**Patterns**:
- `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`
- `test_*.py`, `*_test.py`
- `*_test.rs`
- `*_test.go`
- `*Test.java`, `*Test.kt`

**Compliance checks**:
- Were test files created BEFORE implementation files?
- Do test files have corresponding implementation files?
- Were tests run and shown to fail (RED)?
- Were tests run and shown to pass (GREEN)?

---

### Specification Files

**Patterns**:
- `.wrangler/specifications/*.md`
- `specs/*.md`

**Triggers**:
1. `check-constitutional-alignment` - BEFORE creation
2. `writing-plans` - AFTER creation

**Compliance checks**:
- Was constitutional check performed?
- Was plan created from specification?

---

### Configuration Files

**Patterns**:
- `package.json` (if adding scripts/logic)
- `tsconfig.json` (if changing compiler logic)
- `*.config.js`, `*.config.ts`
- CI/CD files (`.github/workflows/*.yml`)

**Triggers**:
- `requesting-code-review` - If logic changes
- Exception: Dependency updates only (no review needed)

**Compliance checks**:
- If logic changed: was code review obtained?
- If dependency only: documented as exception?

---

## Subagent Usage Patterns

### When Subagents Should Be Used

**Pattern 1: Code Review**
- Always dispatch `code-review` subagent after code changes
- Never skip review (except 3 documented exceptions)

**Pattern 2: Parallel Investigation**
- Dispatch investigation subagents for 3+ independent failures
- Each subagent investigates one problem domain

**Pattern 3: Implementation**
- `/wrangler:implement` dispatches subagents for plan tasks
- Each subagent implements one task with TDD + review

**Compliance checks**:
- Were subagents actually dispatched?
- Were subagent results verified independently?
- Were subagent claims verified with evidence?

---

## Skill Announcement Verification

All skills MUST announce usage with:

```
🔧 Using Skill: [skill-name] | [purpose]
```

**Compliance check**:
- Search conversation for skill announcements
- Verify announcements match expected skills for task
- Flag missing announcements as violations

---

**Severity**: Medium

---

## Validation Workflow

To validate skill invocation compliance:

1. **Identify task type** from conversation
2. **Look up expected skills** in this document
3. **Search for skill announcements** in conversation
4. **Verify skill steps were followed** (check evidence)
5. **Flag violations** with severity and explanation
6. **Recommend corrections** for any violations

---

## Integration with Validation Command

The `/wrangler:validate-session-adherence` command uses this document to:

1. Parse conversation messages
2. Identify task patterns
3. Determine expected skills
4. Compare expected vs actual skill usage
5. Generate compliance report with violations
