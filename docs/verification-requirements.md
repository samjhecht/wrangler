# Verification Requirements

This document defines what evidence is required before making various claims during development. Following these requirements ensures honesty, builds trust, and prevents bugs from slipping through.

**Core Principle**: Evidence before claims, always.

---

## Test Verification

### Claiming "Tests Pass"

**Required Evidence**:

1. **Exact command executed**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   # or
   pytest
   # or
   cargo test
   # or
   go test ./...
   # or
   mvn test
   ```

2. **Complete output showing**:
   - Test count: "X tests passed"
   - Failure count: "0 failed"
   - Duration: "Time: X.XXXs"
   - Exit code: 0

3. **Coverage report (if available)**:
   - Statement coverage: X%
   - Branch coverage: X%
   - Function coverage: X%
   - Line coverage: X%

**Example of VALID verification**:

```
I've verified all tests pass. Here's the output:

$ npm test

PASS tests/auth.test.ts (4.231s)
  ✓ login with valid credentials (231ms)
  ✓ login with invalid credentials (12ms)
  ✓ logout successfully (8ms)

PASS tests/users.test.ts (2.145s)
  ✓ creates new user (145ms)
  ✓ updates existing user (98ms)
  ✓ deletes user (76ms)

Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
Tests:       6 passed, 6 total
Time:        6.376s

Process exited with code 0

All 6 tests pass successfully.
```

**Example of INVALID verification**:

❌ "I ran the tests and they pass."
❌ "Tests are green."
❌ "Everything looks good."
❌ [Shows only 1 test when there are 50]
❌ [Shows truncated output without pass/fail counts]

---

## TDD Verification

### Claiming "Followed TDD"

**Required Evidence**:

1. **RED Phase Evidence**:
   ```
   Running RED phase verification:

   $ npm test -- retry.test.ts

   FAIL tests/retry.test.ts
     ✕ retries failed operations 3 times (2 ms)

     ● retries failed operations 3 times

       ReferenceError: retryOperation is not defined

         at Object.<anonymous> (tests/retry.test.ts:15:5)

   Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 total
   Tests:       1 failed, 1 total
   Exit code: 1

   This is the expected failure - function doesn't exist yet.
   Proceeding to GREEN phase.
   ```

2. **GREEN Phase Evidence**:
   ```
   Running GREEN phase verification:

   $ npm test -- retry.test.ts

   PASS tests/retry.test.ts
     ✓ retries failed operations 3 times (145 ms)

   Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
   Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
   Exit code: 0

   Test now passes. Proceeding to REFACTOR phase.
   ```

3. **TDD Compliance Certification**:
   ```markdown
   ## TDD Compliance Certification

   - [x] **Function name**: retryOperation
     - **Test name**: test_retries_failed_operations_3_times
     - **Watched fail**: YES
     - **Failure reason**: "ReferenceError: retryOperation is not defined"
     - **Implemented minimal code**: YES
     - **Watched pass**: YES
     - **Refactored**: YES (extracted delay logic)

   - [x] **Function name**: validateEmail
     - **Test name**: test_validates_email_format
     - **Watched fail**: YES
     - **Failure reason**: "ReferenceError: validateEmail is not defined"
     - **Implemented minimal code**: YES
     - **Watched pass**: YES
     - **Refactored**: N/A
   ```

**Invalid TDD Claims**:

❌ "I followed TDD" (without certification)
❌ "Tests were written first" (without RED/GREEN output)
❌ "I watched it fail/pass in my head"
❌ Vague about failure messages
❌ Can't describe what failure message was seen
❌ "Followed the spirit of TDD" (without RED-GREEN evidence)

---

## Build Verification

### Claiming "Build Succeeds"

**Required Evidence**:

1. **Exact command executed**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   cargo build
   # or
   mvn package
   # or
   make build
   ```

2. **Complete output showing**:
   - Build steps completed
   - No errors
   - Exit code: 0
   - Output artifacts created

**Example**:

```
$ npm run build

> project@1.0.0 build
> tsc && vite build

✓ 156 modules transformed.
dist/index.html                   0.45 kB
dist/assets/index-abc123.js     125.32 kB
dist/assets/index-xyz789.css      8.21 kB

Build completed in 3.2s
Exit code: 0
```

**Invalid Claims**:

❌ "Linter passed" (linter doesn't check compilation)
❌ "Should build fine" (speculation, not evidence)
❌ "No syntax errors" (doesn't prove build succeeds)

## Subagent Verification

### Claiming "Subagent Completed Task"

**Required Evidence**:

```

**Invalid Claims**:

❌ Trusting subagent report without verification
❌ "Agent said it works" (no independent check)
❌ Skipping test execution

---

## Regression Test Verification

### Claiming "Regression Test Works"

**Required Evidence**:

1. **RED-GREEN Cycle Verification**:
   ```
   Step 1: Write test
   Step 2: Run test → PASSES (bug not reproduced yet)
   Step 3: Revert fix → Run test → FAILS (bug reproduced)
   Step 4: Restore fix → Run test → PASSES (fix verified)
   ```

**Process**:

```bash
# Write regression test
git add test/regression.test.ts
git commit -m "test: add regression test for bug X"

# Verify test passes with fix
npm test -- regression.test.ts
# → PASS (bug is fixed)

# Revert fix temporarily
git stash
npm test -- regression.test.ts
# → FAIL (test catches the bug)

# Restore fix
git stash pop
npm test -- regression.test.ts
# → PASS (fix verified)
```

**Invalid Claims**:

❌ "I've written a regression test" (without RED-GREEN cycle)
❌ Test never shown to fail (doesn't prove it catches bug)

---

   p50: 75ms (67% improvement)
   p95: 120ms (68% improvement)
   p99: 180ms (65% improvement)
   ```

2. **Profiler Data**:
   - Flame graphs showing improvement
   - Memory allocation reduction
   - CPU time reduction

**Invalid Claims**:

❌ "Should be faster now" (no measurement)
❌ "Feels quicker" (subjective)
❌ No before/after comparison

---

   # → 0 broken links
   ```

**Invalid Claims**:

❌ "Documentation updated" (no checklist)
❌ Broken links present
❌ Missing examples for new features

---

## Common Verification Patterns

### Pattern: Command Output Verification

**Template**:

```
Verification step: [what we're verifying]

$ [exact command]

[complete output]

Exit code: [0 or error code]

[interpretation of results]
```

### Pattern: Checklist Verification

**Template**:

```markdown
## [Verification Category]

- [x] Item 1: [what was verified]
  - Evidence: [specific proof]
- [x] Item 2: [what was verified]
  - Evidence: [specific proof]
- [ ] Item 3: [what failed]
  - Issue: [what's wrong]
  - Action: [what to do]

[Summary]: X/Y items verified, Z items need attention
```

### Pattern: Before/After Verification

**Template**:

```
BEFORE:
[baseline measurement]

CHANGES:
[what was modified]

AFTER:
[new measurement]

IMPACT:
[comparison and interpretation]
```

---

## Red Flags (Stop and Verify)

### Language Red Flags

If you catch yourself using these words, STOP and verify:

❌ "should"
❌ "probably"
❌ "seems to"
❌ "looks like"
❌ "I think"
❌ "appears to"
❌ "likely"

These indicate speculation, not verification.

### Behavior Red Flags

❌ Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Perfect!")
❌ About to commit/push/PR without verification
❌ Trusting agent success reports
❌ Relying on partial verification
❌ Thinking "just this once"
❌ Tired and wanting work over
❌ Paraphrasing results instead of showing raw output

---

## Verification Hierarchy

**Level 1: Automated Tests** (Most Reliable)
- Command output from test suite
- Exit codes
- Coverage reports

**Level 2: Build Verification**
- Compilation success
- No warnings/errors
- Output artifacts created

**Level 3: Manual Verification**
- Visual inspection
- Browser testing
- Accessibility checks

**Level 4: Human Review**
- Code review
- Security review
- Architecture review

**DO NOT SKIP LEVELS**. Each level provides additional confidence.
