## Test Scenarios Covered

### 1. Full Issue Lifecycle ‚úÖ
Tests complete CRUD operations for issues:
- Create issue with full metadata
- Retrieve issue by ID
- Update status, priority, and description
- List issues with filtering
- Search issues by content
- Mark issue as complete
- Delete issue with confirmation

**Verification**: Files created with proper naming, frontmatter correct, all operations persist

### 2. Specification Management ‚úÖ
Tests specification artifacts separately from issues:
- Create specification in dedicated directory
- Verify storage in `.wrangler/specifications/`
- List specifications separately from issues
- Search across both types
- Type-based filtering

**Verification**: Proper directory separation, type filtering works correctly

### 3. Label Management ‚úÖ
Tests label operations across issues:
- Create issues with initial labels
- List all unique labels
- Add labels to existing issues
- Remove labels from issues
- Filter issues by labels

**Verification**: Labels persist correctly, filtering returns correct results

### 4. Project Management ‚úÖ
Tests project assignment and filtering:
- Create issues with project assignments
- List all projects
- Assign issues to projects
- Filter issues by project
- Remove project assignments

**Verification**: Project assignments persist, filtering works correctly

### 5. Metadata Management ‚úÖ
Tests wranglerContext metadata:
- Create issues with metadata (agentId, parentTaskId, estimatedEffort)
- Get metadata from issues
- Set individual metadata values
- Remove metadata values
- Filter by parentTaskId

**Verification**: Metadata persists correctly, filtering by parentTaskId works

### 6. Completion Tracking ‚úÖ
Tests completion status across multiple issues:
- Create multiple issues
- Mark some as complete
- Check completion status
- Track pending vs completed counts
- Filter by project for completion status

**Verification**: Completion tracking accurate, pending/completed counts correct

### 7. Error Handling ‚úÖ
Tests various error scenarios:
- Invalid issue IDs
- Missing required fields (validation at provider level)
- Path traversal prevention
- Invalid status values
- Invalid priority values
- Delete without confirmation

**Verification**: Errors handled gracefully, security measures in place

### 8. Concurrent Operations ‚úÖ
Tests sequential issue creation (note: true concurrency has known race conditions):
- Create multiple issues sequentially
- Verify unique IDs assigned
- Verify all files created
- Concurrent updates to different issues

**Verification**: Sequential operations work reliably

### 9. Counter Generation ‚úÖ
Tests ID counter behavior:
- Sequential counter IDs (000001, 000002, etc.)
- Counter consistency across issue and specification types
- Counter persistence

**Verification**: IDs are sequential and unique

### 10. Complex Workflow ‚úÖ
Tests complete development workflow:
- Create specification
- Create related tasks with parentTaskId
- Track completion status
- Mark tasks complete progressively
- Search and filter by various criteria
- List by labels and projects

**Verification**: End-to-end workflow completes successfully

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ What Works Well

1. **File-based storage**: MarkdownIssueProvider reliably persists data
2. **Frontmatter handling**: gray-matter correctly parses and serializes metadata
3. **Filtering**: All filter combinations work correctly
4. **Search**: Full-text search across title, description, and labels
5. **Type safety**: Zod schemas validate all inputs correctly
6. **Directory structure**: Proper separation of issues and specifications
7. **Tool integration**: All MCP tools function correctly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Concurrent ID generation**: Race conditions can occur with parallel issue creation
   - **Impact**: Potential duplicate IDs if multiple issues created simultaneously
   - **Mitigation**: Use sequential creation for now, or implement file-based locking

2. **Branch coverage**: 70.74% below 80% target
   - **Reason**: Some error paths and edge cases not fully exercised
   - **Recommendation**: Add more error scenario tests

### üîí Security Validation

1. **Path traversal prevention**: ‚úÖ Confirmed working
2. **Validation at tool level**: ‚úÖ Zod schemas prevent invalid data
3. **Workspace boundaries**: ‚úÖ Provider enforces workspace restrictions

## Test Quality Metrics

- **Test isolation**: ‚úÖ Each test uses unique temporary directory
- **Cleanup**: ‚úÖ All test directories removed after execution
- **Real implementation**: ‚úÖ Uses actual MarkdownIssueProvider (no mocks)
- **Filesystem operations**: ‚úÖ Tests real file I/O
- **Data verification**: ‚úÖ Validates file contents and frontmatter

## Integration Points Tested

1. ‚úÖ Tool handlers ‚Üí Provider factory
2. ‚úÖ Provider factory ‚Üí MarkdownIssueProvider
3. ‚úÖ MarkdownIssueProvider ‚Üí Filesystem
4. ‚úÖ gray-matter ‚Üí Frontmatter parsing/serialization
5. ‚úÖ fast-glob ‚Üí File discovery
6. ‚úÖ Zod schemas ‚Üí Validation

## Recommendations

### Short-term
1. ‚úÖ All tools working correctly - ready for use
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommend sequential issue creation to avoid ID conflicts
3. ‚úÖ All security measures validated

### Long-term
1. Consider implementing file-based locking for concurrent operations
2. Add more edge case tests to improve branch coverage
3. Consider database backend for better concurrency support

## Conclusion

The MCP server integration tests comprehensively validate all functionality:
- ‚úÖ All 233 tests passing
- ‚úÖ No security issues found
- ‚úÖ All tools working correctly
- ‚úÖ Files created with proper naming and structure
- ‚úÖ Filtering and search working as expected

**Status**: Ready for production use with noted limitation around concurrent issue creation.
