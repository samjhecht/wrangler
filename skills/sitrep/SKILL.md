You are the sitrep workflow coordinator. Your job is to surface what's new since the user's last situational report, ensuring they don't evaluate priorities without knowing the latest learnings.

## Primary Value

**Surface new memos that collaborators created** - so you don't evaluate priorities without knowing the latest learnings.

## Skill Usage Announcement

**MANDATORY**: When using this skill, announce it at the start with:

```
🔧 Using Skill: sitrep | Generating situational awareness report
```

## Multi-Phase Workflow

```
Phase 1: User Detection & State Loading (Sequential)
    ↓
Phase 2: Data Gathering (3 Parallel Subagents)
    ↓
Phase 3: Analysis & Synthesis (Sequential)
    ↓
Phase 4: Report Generation (Sequential)
    ↓
Phase 5: State Update (Sequential)
```

---

## Phase 1: User Detection & State Loading

**Purpose:** Establish identity and load cursor position

### 1.1 Detect User

Run this command to get the user's identity:

```bash
git config user.email
```

Extract username: everything before the `@` symbol.

**Example:** `samjhecht@gmail.com` → `samjhecht`

**Fallback:** If git config fails, use `anonymous` as username.

### 1.2 Load State File

State files are stored in `.wrangler/cache/{username}-sitrep.json`

**State file format:**
```json
{
  "created_at": "2026-01-10T09:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-01-15T18:30:00Z",
  "cursor": {
    "commit": "7313e60"
  },
  "stats": {
    "runs": 12,
    "memos_surfaced": 47,
    "decisions_found": 23,
    "questions_found": 8
  }
}
```

### 1.3 Handle Arguments

Check if `--full` flag was passed in arguments:

- **`--full` present:** Ignore cursor, treat as first-run (show last 7 days)
- **No flag:** Use cursor from state file

### 1.4 Handle Edge Cases

| Case | Handling |
|------|----------|
| No state file exists | First-run: show last 7 days, announce "First sitrep for {username}" |
| `--full` flag | Ignore cursor, treat as first-run |
| State file corrupted/invalid JSON | Delete file, treat as first-run |
| Username detection fails | Fallback to `anonymous` |

### 1.5 Determine Time Range

Based on state and flags, determine:

```
cursor_commit = state.cursor.commit OR null
cursor_date = date of cursor commit OR "7 days ago"
```

**Output from Phase 1:**
- `username` - User identity
- `cursor_commit` - Last commit seen (or null for first-run)
- `cursor_date` - Human-readable start date
- `is_first_run` - Boolean

---

## Phase 2: Data Gathering (Parallel Subagents)

**Why parallel:** Three independent data sources with no dependencies.

Launch **three parallel subagents** using the Task tool in a **single message**:

### Subagent A: Git History Analysis

**Task prompt:**

```
Analyze git history for sitrep report.

Cursor: {cursor_commit or "7 days ago"}

Commands to run:
- If cursor commit exists:
  git log {cursor_commit}..HEAD --format="%H|%ae|%s|%ai" --no-merges
- If no cursor (first-run):
  git log --since="7 days ago" --format="%H|%ae|%s|%ai" --no-merges

Output needed:
1. Latest commit hash (for new cursor)
2. Commits grouped by author with counts
3. Decisions extracted from commit messages

Decision extraction - look for:
- Messages containing: "decided", "chose", "switched to", "migrated"
- Conventional commits: feat:, fix: (these represent decisions)
- Breaking changes: BREAKING CHANGE

Return JSON format:
{
  "latest_commit": "abc123...",
  "commit_count": 15,
  "authors": [
    {"email": "user@example.com", "count": 5, "representative_messages": ["msg1", "msg2"]}
  ],
  "decisions": [
    {"summary": "Switched to TypeScript", "commit": "abc123", "author": "user@example.com"}
  ]
}
```

---

### Subagent B: Memo Surfacing (CRITICAL)

**Task prompt:**

```
Surface new memos for sitrep report. This is the MOST IMPORTANT subagent task.

Cursor date: {cursor_date}

Steps:
1. List memos with modification times:
   ls -lt .wrangler/memos/*.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No memos"

2. For each memo newer than cursor date, extract:
   - Title (first H1 heading or filename)
   - 2-3 sentence summary (first paragraph after title)
   - Decisions (look for "## Decision", "we decided", "decided to")
   - Open questions (look for "## Open Questions", "??" in headers, "TBD:", "TODO:")

3. Categorize memos by type based on filename patterns:
   - RCA-*.md → Root Cause Analysis
   - SUMMARY-*.md → Summary/Recap
   - ANALYSIS-*.md → Analysis
   - DECISION-*.md → Decision Record
   - Other → General memo

Return JSON format:
{
  "new_memos": [
    {
      "filename": "2026-01-15-auth-failure-rca.md",
      "title": "Authentication Failure Root Cause",
      "type": "RCA",
      "date": "2026-01-15",
      "summary": "JWT validation was failing due to clock skew...",
      "decisions": ["Switched to asymmetric JWT verification"],
      "questions": ["Should we add clock tolerance?"]
    }
  ],
  "decisions_from_memos": [...],
  "open_questions": [...]
}

If no memos directory or no new memos, return:
{
  "new_memos": [],
  "decisions_from_memos": [],
  "open_questions": [],
  "note": "No memos in workspace" OR "No new memos since cursor"
}
```

---

### Subagent C: Issue & Roadmap Status

**Task prompt:**

```
Gather issue and roadmap status for sitrep report.

Use MCP tools to query:
1. issues_list({ status: ["open"] }) - Count open issues
2. issues_list({ status: ["in_progress"] }) - Count in-progress issues
3. issues_list({ priority: ["critical", "high"], status: ["open"] }) - High-priority open items

Read roadmap file:
- .wrangler/ROADMAP_NEXT_STEPS.md - Extract current phase and completion %

Return JSON format:
{
  "issues": {
    "open_count": 5,
    "in_progress_count": 3,
    "high_priority_open": [
      {"id": "000001", "title": "Fix auth bug", "priority": "critical"}
    ]
  },
  "roadmap": {
    "current_phase": "Phase 2: Core Features",
    "completion_pct": 65,
    "note": "Extracted from ROADMAP_NEXT_STEPS.md"
  }
}

If no issues or roadmap file:
{
  "issues": {"open_count": 0, "in_progress_count": 0, "high_priority_open": []},
  "roadmap": {"current_phase": "Unknown", "completion_pct": null, "note": "No roadmap file found"}
}
```

---

### Parallel Execution

**CRITICAL:** All three Task tool calls must be in a **single message** to execute truly in parallel.

```
I'm launching three parallel sitrep data gathering agents:

[Task tool - Subagent A: Git History Analysis]
[Task tool - Subagent B: Memo Surfacing]
[Task tool - Subagent C: Issue & Roadmap Status]

All three agents are now running in parallel...
```

---

## Phase 3: Analysis & Synthesis

**Why sequential:** Needs results from all Phase 2 subagents.

### 3.1 Aggregate Results

Collect and parse JSON results from all three subagents.

### 3.2 Deduplicate Decisions

Decisions may appear in both commits and memos. Deduplicate by:
1. Normalize decision text (lowercase, strip punctuation)
2. Check for similar decisions (fuzzy match)
3. Keep one entry, note source as "commit and memo" if both

### 3.3 Priority Re-evaluation Heuristics

Analyze new information for priority implications:

| Trigger | Suggested Change |
|---------|------------------|
| New RCA memo about component X | Related issues → higher priority |
| Specification closed | Child issues → review for obsolescence |
| Critical bug in recent commits | Related issues → may be blocked |
| Decision changes architecture | Related issues → may need update |

**Important:** Sitrep SUGGESTS priority changes. Human decides.

### 3.4 Calculate Stats

For state file update:
```
new_memos_count = len(new_memos)
decisions_count = len(deduplicated_decisions)
questions_count = len(open_questions)
```

---

## Phase 4: Report Generation

**Read `templates/report.md`** for the full report template and variable reference.

Generate the sitrep report by:
1. Reading the template from `templates/report.md`
2. Substituting all variables with data from Phases 1-3
3. Outputting the formatted markdown report

### Priority Emoji Mapping (Quick Reference)

| Priority | Emoji |
|----------|-------|
| `critical` | 🔴 |
| `high` | 🟠 |
| `medium` | 🟡 |
| `low` | 🟢 |

---

## Phase 5: State Update

### 5.1 Ensure Cache Directory Exists

```bash
mkdir -p .wrangler/cache
```

### 5.2 Write Updated State File

Write to `.wrangler/cache/{username}-sitrep.json`:

```json
{
  "created_at": "{original_created_at OR now if first run}",
  "updated_at": "{now ISO8601}",
  "cursor": {
    "commit": "{latest_commit_hash from Subagent A}"
  },
  "stats": {
    "runs": {previous_runs + 1},
    "memos_surfaced": {previous + new_memos_count},
    "decisions_found": {previous + decisions_count},
    "questions_found": {previous + questions_count}
  }
}
```

### 5.3 Confirm State Saved

Announce: "Sitrep state saved. Next sitrep will start from commit {latest_commit_hash}."

---

## Edge Cases

| Case | Handling |
|------|----------|
| No git repo | Skip git analysis, warn user, continue with memos/issues |
| No memos directory | "No memos in workspace" in report |
| No .wrangler directory | "Wrangler not initialized - run session-start hook" |
| No issues | "No issues tracked yet" |
| Cursor commit rebased away | `git log {cursor}..HEAD` will fail; fall back to last 30 days |
| Empty workspace | Generate report with all "No new..." messages |
| Subagent fails | Report partial data, note which source failed |

### Handling Rebased Cursor

If git log with cursor fails:

```bash
# Check if cursor commit exists
git cat-file -t {cursor_commit} 2>/dev/null
```

If not found:
1. Log warning: "Previous cursor commit not found (rebased?)"
2. Fall back to: `git log --since="30 days ago"`
3. Note in report: "Using 30-day fallback due to rebased history"

---

## Verification Checklist

After implementation, verify these scenarios work:

1. **First-run:** No state file → shows 7 days, creates state file
2. **Incremental:** Add memo, run sitrep → only new memo appears
3. **--full flag:** Ignores cursor, shows everything
4. **Multi-user:** Switch git user → separate state files
5. **Decision extraction:** Memo with `## Decision` → appears in report
6. **Empty workspace:** No errors, graceful messages
7. **State persistence:** Run twice → second run shows "since" first run's cursor

---

## Important Notes

### Read-Only Operations

This skill is **read-only** for governance files:
- Does NOT invoke refresh-metrics
- Does NOT update roadmap files
- Does NOT modify issues

Only writes to: `.wrangler/cache/{username}-sitrep.json`

### Subagent Types

When launching parallel subagents, use:
- `subagent_type: "Explore"` for Subagent A (git analysis) and Subagent B (memo surfacing)
- `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` for Subagent C (uses MCP tools)

### Model Selection

For efficiency, subagents can use `model: "haiku"` since tasks are straightforward data gathering.

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: First Sitrep on Project

**User:** `/wrangler:sitrep`

**Agent Response:**
1. "First sitrep for samjhecht - showing last 7 days..."
2. Launches 3 parallel subagents
3. Generates report with all activity from past week
4. Creates state file with current cursor

### Example 2: Daily Check-in

**User:** `/wrangler:sitrep`

**Agent Response:**
1. "Loading sitrep state from 2 days ago..."
2. Launches 3 parallel subagents (filtered to since cursor)
3. "2 new memos since last sitrep!"
4. Generates focused report
5. Updates state file

### Example 3: Full Overview

**User:** `/wrangler:sitrep --full`

**Agent Response:**
1. "Full sitrep requested - ignoring cursor, showing last 7 days..."
2. Same as first-run flow
3. Updates cursor but doesn't reset stats

---
